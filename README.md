Our initial idea was to use the Robocar as a service robot inside a home.  
Some initial thoughts for a use case were:
* Detect and track people and pets
* Keep an eye on the pet and report abnormal activites to the owner
  
Our new idea will be to focus on navigating in unstructured environments and to target the last-mile delivery aspect. Since the last-mile delivery robot will more or less resemble the size of an RC car, we intend to work on the technology to support this idea - deep learning for image segmentation and object detection, path planning and controls.
